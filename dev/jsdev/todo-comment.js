// TODO: allow a background image and an opacity for the background colour - need to catch error and make readable error for tainted image and this code needs to be programmatically activated as an advanced mode (tried copying into intermediate canvas but that didn't work) - workaround add links to png to jpg online conversion services
// TODO: when image and opacity is available allow 'margin' for the background colour to adjust amount of background image shown
// TODO: can we pull in list of font names supported by browser rather than hard code?
// TODO: make javascript control html template more configurable and code generated
// TODO: add a background circle
// TODO: add linear gradiant background, background shape
// TODO: add radial gradiant background, background shape
